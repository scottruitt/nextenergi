        <h1 class="pb30">Glossary of new energy terms</h1>
        <h4 class="white" id="BEMS">Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">BEMS is a class of technologies, processes, products and services whose purpose is to address energy efficiency in commercial buildings. BEMS includes energy management technologies, sub-metered systems and software to provide building managers with energy usage data and feedback, but also lower tech energy efficiency solutions such as spray foam and double-paned windows.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="CHP">Combined Heat and Power (CHP)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">CHP describes a power generator whose heat exhaust is channeled for productive value by the end user. Previously referred to as cogeneration, CHP is the simultaneous production of power and the capture of exhaust heat to provide thermal energy, to be used, for instance, to heat water for a district energy plant. Natural Gas turbines, in particular small scale turbines, (i.e., Micro CHP) – spin very rapidly and produce high heat, so they are typically associated with the use of exhaust heat. See also <a href="#DG">Distributed Generation (DG)</a> and <a href="#DER">Distributed Energy Resources (DER)</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="CCA">Community Choice Aggregation (CCA)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">CCA is US innovation substitute for power provisioning, replacing <a href="#IOU">Investor Owned Utility (IOU)</a> electric sourcing with local (e.g., county or multi-county) non-profit entities. Under CCA law, these organizations aggregate the buying power of individual customers in their service territory to secure alternative energy supply contracts, almost exclusively with the goal of securing green power contracts, whether from large remote farms or from local <a href="#DER">DER</a> facilities. CCA customers default IN, so that they must actively opt out if they do not wish to be supplied by the CCA entity. Seven states have CCA laws (CA, IL, MA, NJ, NY, OH & RI), but only California has a comprehensive, active CCA marketplace to date.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="CCE">Community Clean Energy (CCE)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">CCE is an alternative name for a <a href="#CCA">CCA</a> entity (e.g., East Bay Community Energy, Silicon Valley Clean Energy, etc.).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="CES">Community Energy Storage (CES)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">CES is the application of energy storage technology to support a small number of residential or commercial load centers, akin to a neighborhood energy storage facility, considered by some to be the sweet spot for immediate application based on current technology maturity, capabilities, and price points.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="CommunitySolar">Community Solar</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Community Solar, sometimes referred to as a <a href="#SolarGarden">Solar Garden</a>, is a mid-sized <a href="#PV">Solar PV</a> system (100-500 KW) that produces energy for use by a group of individuals (community).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="CEU">Critical Energy User (CEU)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A Critical Energy User (CEU) is an energy consumer for whom energy is of critical importance to its mission and to society. When a power outage disables such a user, society and the local economy suffer significant to catastrophic impacts. Historically, CEUs have used diesel generators & UPS as customer-owned power backup resources.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="DR">Demand Response (DR)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">DR is a change in the power consumption of an electric utility customer at the request of the utility to better match power demand with power supply. The electric grid requires demand and supply to be in balance from moment to moment, given the lack of economical energy storage options. Historically, utilities throttled power plant production to keep demand and supply in balance, ramping generators up or down, or importing power. DR represents an alternative means to balance the grid. DR systems consist of a remote control unit connected to a wireless network, used to automate load curtailment as an alternative to dispatching additional supply resources.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="DERResiliency">DER Resiliency</h4>
        <p class="pb30">New <a href="#DER">DER</a> technologies capabilities and business models enable dramatic improvements to service reliability including partial or full avoidance of outages. DER Resiliency describes the transformation of the distribution grid by leveraging new DER capabilities and business models to ensure <a href="#PowerContinuity">power continuity</a> for <a href="#CEU">Critical Energy Users (CEUs)</a> during outage events.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="dispatchable">Dispatchable</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Utility operators traditionally dispatch power from central generation resources to keep the grid voltage levels in balance. A challenge to renewable energy resources like wind and solar energy is that the power they produce is intermittent, due to the nature of wind and sunlight. Consequently, the power renewable energy resources produce is not considered “dispatchable” by grid operators and must be backed up by gas or coal generation resources in the event they suddenly become unavailable. In Smart Grid terms on the distribution grid, <a href="#DER">DER</a> resources will be deemed dispatchable generation resources if they are equipped with communication devices and micro inverters and grid operators can dispatch them similar to the way they dispatch central power today. <a href="#DR">DR</a> resources may also be considered as dispatchable generation resources if they consistently curtail on demand with a record of that curtailment.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="DER">Distributed Energy Resources (DER)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Alternately, Decentralized Energy Resources – DER is a relatively new umbrella term for technology-driven onsite-power devices and systems that includes Energy Efficiency (including <a href="#HEMS">Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)</a> and <a href="#BEMS">Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS)</a>) <a href="#DR">Demand Response (DR)</a>, <a href="#DG">Distributed Generation (DG)</a>; <a href="#EV">Electric Vehicles (EV)</a> and <a href="#EVSE">Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)</a> and <a href="#ES">Energy Storage (ES)</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="DG">Distributed Generation (DG)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">DG describes small, diverse onsite power generators that operate to meet individual loads near to the load that they serve and/or provide power directly onto the distribution grid. DG includes such clean energy technology as rooftop <a href="#PV">Solar PV</a> systems, micro gas turbines using combined heat and power (<a href="#CHP">micro CHP</a>), as well as less common micro wind turbine systems and more traditional portable gas and diesel generators.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="DistributedSolarPV">Distributed Solar Photo Voltaic (PV)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Distributed solar PV is small energy production system that uses solar panels to produce energy at a site where the energy is consumed, stored, or sold over the grid, typically sized under 100 KW.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="DPP">Distribution Power Producer (DPP)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">The rise of Positive Energy Buildings, other <a href="#DER">DER</a> and <a href="#Microgrid">microgrids</a> enable the potential to export power directly onto the low voltage distribution feeder in a deliberate merchant capacity as a DPP, a term that applies the <a href="#IPP">IPP</a> concept to onsite power production that powers a particular distribution feeder.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id ="DRP">Distribution Resource Plan (DRP)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A DRP applies the <a href="#IRP">IRP</a> concept to include resource activity inside the distribution grid ecosystem to accommodate new <a href="#DER">Distributed Energy Resources (DER)</a> and more frequent, dynamic planning cycles.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id ="EV">Electric Vehicles (EV)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">EV is an expanding umbrella term for vehicles that make use of electric batteries, including hybrids, which combine energy storage and an internal combustion engine (ICE); plug-in hybrids (typically have a small onboard generator) or 100% electric vehicles (PEVs); battery electric vehicles (BEVs) such as specialty equipment in warehouses and airports; and electric buses. EVs are widely viewed as the most likely replacement for vehicles that depend on fossil fuels (e.g., ICE). See also <a href="#V2G">Vehicle to Grid (V2G) and Vehicle to Home (V2H)</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="EVSE">Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">EVSE is the charging system complement to the electric vehicles in the <a href="#EV">EV</a> category used to describe individual chargers as well as networked chargers that will comprise a large overlay network onto the power grid. Charging stations are likely to be deployed at residences and businesses, as well as at public locations including charging stations available to the public at curbside, parking garages, and parking lots.</p>
        <h4 class="white">Energy Consumption v. Energy Demand</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A distribution grid is designed and built to service a projected system peak load – the time during the year of maximum energy consumption, when all generation units are operating at full capacity to meet demand and the distribution grid is at peak capacity as well. Energy consumption, measured in <a href="#kW">kWh</a>, is the cumulative amount of energy represented by the area under the load curve over a specific amount of time. Energy demand, measured in <a href="#kW">kW</a>, is the highest point of the load curve over a specific amount of time. Residential consumers typically are charged only for consumption, while commercial and industrial consumers pay for both consumption and demand. This is because rates are designed to recover both capital and operational costs. Electric utilities invest capital for generation, transmission, and distribution assets – capacity to meet peak demand, but also operational expenses such as fuel costs to produce energy.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="EE">Energy Efficiency (EE)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Energy Efficiency or EE is a focused on the demand side of the energy equation, on energy consumption. The built infrastructure – buildings and homes – consumes approximately 70 percent of electricity, so focusing on eliminating wasteful consumption becomes a way of operating a more efficient system. EE may be divided into passive strategies, principally focused on sealing the building envelope as a more effective container of heat or cold (insulation, radiant barrier, etc.) and on upgrading energy appliances to the most efficient models and technologies (replacing incandescent light bulbs with CFLs and <a href="#LED">LEDs</a>, switching <a href="#HVAC">HVAC</a> to a higher SEER rating). EE may be low-tech (turning off light bulbs when leaving the room, sealing cracks around doors and windows) or high-tech (spray foam insulation, programmable <a href="#HEMS">HEMS</a>).</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="EnergySelfSufficiency">Energy Self Sufficiency</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Energy self sufficiency (ESS) and freedom from loss of service (i.e., electricity outages) are two of the principal benefits from becoming a <a href="#Prosumer">prosumer</a>, one who gains energy independence with onsite production and expanded capabilities.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="ESPA">Energy Service Purchase Agreement (ESPA)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">An  ESPA is inclusive of power &and; devices that when viewed as a package provides a service (e.g., comfort, lighting, hot water, etc.) … an ESPA enables “as a service” value-adds as an innovation to deliver more value than can be found from the separate purchases of an energy appliance (device) and the electricity to run it (<a href="#kW">kWhs</a>). The ESPA “locks-in” a portion of the monthly energy bill in a long-term contract (service level agreement or SLA), reducing rate-based kWhs. An ESPA may be seen as a Load strategy to preserve grid service, where rate-based kWhs transform into a cost input into a service contract.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="ES">Energy Storage (ES)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Energy Storage  may be fixed or mobile, as in the case of <a href="#EV">EVs</a>. Fixed ES comes in different sizes, ranging from personal ES serving one home or building, to community ES serving a neighborhood or group of homes or buildings, to utility-scale ES, as a component of the distribution grid used for energy balancing, ancillary services, renewable energy integration, or arbitrage. Principal types of energy storage include 1) mechanical – hydroelectric (pumped hydro), compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, etc.; 2) electrochemical – lead acid batteries, advanced lead acid batteries, sodium sulfur and flow batteries, fuel cells, etc.; 3) electrical – capacitors, super capacitors, ultra capacitors; 4) thermal – ice, molten salt, etc.; and 5) chemical, biological, etc. ES holds great potential as a disruptor to the current electricity paradigm, which has generally been a just-in-time system, designed and operated in real time without the capacity for managing peaks with the benefit of stored energy.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="GridParity">Grid Parity</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Grid Parity described a time in the near term, when new types of electricity, typically renewable energy and <a href="#DER">DER</a>, achieve the same or lower levelized cost of energy than traditional – typically, fossil fuel-based – forms of electricity. At grid parity, the incumbent advantages of traditional electricity generation fall away and replacement with new clean electricity becomes predominate. Many believe we have now passed this point.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="HVAC">Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems</h4>
        <p class="pb30">HVAC systems manage temperature and humidity environment for buildings and homes, so the term includes heaters, boilers, air conditioners, chillers, refrigeration units, etc. For Smart Grid purposes, HVAC systems matter because they are often the largest single energy-consuming appliance inside the building or home. For <a href="#DR">DR</a>, <a href="#HEMS">HEMS</a> units interface with the HVAC, providing feedback on energy consumption, but more importantly, direct control to cycle the HVAC on and off to reduce energy consumption during peak periods.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="HPPV">High Penetration PV (HPPV)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">HPPV describes efforts to load up a single distribution circuit on the grid with higher concentrations of <a href="#PV">Solar PV</a> facilities than current standards allow. An initial rule of thumb was that a single distribution feeder could only handle about a 20 percent penetration of PV, beyond which the potential for intolerable risk and instability to grid operations sets a boundary. The intermittency of production and the potential for excess power to reverse the power flow on distribution feeder lines pose a threat to upstream utility equipment. HPPV anticipates new technologies and processes that will enable the distribution grid to safely accommodate ever larger concentrations of <a href="#DER">DER</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="HEMS">Home Energy Management System (HEMS)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">HEMS is an acronym for a new class of consumer devices that combine equipment and software to provide consumers with a feedback mechanism to better monitor and manage their in-home energy consumption. Closely related to home area networks or HANs, HEMS may include a connection to the Smart Meter, drawing revenue data from the meter via ZigBee connectivity. HEMS will enable <a href="#DR">DR</a> services to the degree that they automate or facilitate consumer decisions to curtail power during peak periods at the request of the utility.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="ISO">Independent System Operator (ISO)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">The FERC directs the formation of ISOs for individual states, but also sometimes regions, as a coordination and monitoring mechanism to provide oversight and direction to regional electric grids for reliability purposes. An ISO may also have the purview over market operations of the wholesale power market in a region as well, overseeing power dispatch and grid balancing, but also providing a market clearing function.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="IPP">Independent Power Producer (IPP)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">An Independent Power Producer or IPP was introduced with the PURPA electricity reforms in the 1970s, whereby third party (i.e., non-utility) producers own and operate power plants and sell power onto the transmission grid and to end users (large power producers).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="IRP">Integrated Resource Plan (IRP)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">An Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) is a term coined under the PURPA laws (circa 1978) to move beyond generation planning focused on utility-owned power plant investments to more diversity in energy resources (e.g., energy efficiency, etc.) and more inclusive of third parties (<a href="#IPP">Independent Power Producers (IPPs)</a> and Energy Service Companies – ESCos).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="IOU">Investor Owned Utility (IOU)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">IOUs are one of three principal classes of electric utilities in the US. IOUs are owned by private investors and are typically larger than the other two types of utilities, <a href="#MOU">Municipally-Owned Utilities (MOUs)</a> and electric cooperatives (Co-ops). IOUs are regulated at the state and federal level. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) is the industry body most closely associated with IOUs.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="kW">Kilowatt (kW), Kilowatt Hour (kWh)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A kW is a term to define energy generation capacity equal to 1,000 watts, whereas a kWh is a common unit of measurement for electric power consumption equal to 1,000 watts in one hour or 3.6 megajoules. The kW is used as a billing unit by electric utilities for energy demand, whereas the kWh is used to measure and bill the amount of energy consumed.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="LCOE">Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">LCOE, measured in <a href="#kW">kWh</a> or <a href="#MW">MWh</a>, is a way of comparing energy from different generation sources, using such measurements as initial capital investment, ROI, operating costs, fuel cost, and maintenance costs.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="LED">Light Emitting Diode (LED)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">An LED is an electronic device that produces light using semiconductor chips, a technology that has advanced over nearly 50 years to become an alternative to incandescent light bulbs and compact fluorescent light bulbs. Advantages of LEDs are numerous: lower energy consumption, longer life, smaller size, faster switching, and greater durability and reliability. The principal advantage of LEDs is their low operating costs, but that is offset by their still relatively high upfront costs, although the price is in rapid decline. LEDs are increasingly in use in small form factors such as flashlights and decorative holiday light strings.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="MW">Megawatt (MW), Megawatt Hour (MWh)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A MW is a measure of energy capacity, a million watts, and is generally the measurement used to describe the capacity of large generators. In contrast, a MWh is a power measurement, multiplying the capacity over a period of one hour. A 100 MW generator produces 100 MWh in one hour. Collectively, 1,000 homes consuming 1,000 <a href="#kW">kWh</a> each month consume 12 MWh over one year.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="MDM">Meter Data Management (MDM), Meter Data Management System (MDMS)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">MDM, is a new requirement for data coming from digital Smart Meters, which will dramatically increase as more and more AMI systems are deployed, making management of that data a new critical skill for utilities. The raw data that comes from the Smart Meters is stored in head end servers, processed, and then used for digital billing and other analytical purposes. MDMS is the term for the system that performs the MDM function. MDM is a vital component of the value production of Smart Grid, given that data will feed the variety of applications inside a utility to drive processes and deliver desired outcomes.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="Microgrid">Microgrid</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A microgrid, in its original definition, is a campus of buildings that have access to multiple onsite energy resources, energy storage and managed loads to enable independent operations (i.e., “islanding”). As microgrids become more common, moving from concepts to reality, the concept is used to describe variations (e.g., see also Distribution Feeder Microgrid, <a href="#Nanogrid">Nanogrid</a>, <a href="#ProximityMicrogrid">Proximity Microgrid</a>, etc.)</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="MGMS">Microgrid Management System (MGMS)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">An MGMS enables the efficient operation of a <a href="#Microgrid">microgrid</a>, balancing system resources, loads, and energy storage.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="MOU">Municipally Owned Utility (MOU)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Community-owned utilities, known in the industry as MOUs, are city departments operated by city employees with direct or indirect board oversight by city government (city councils or independent boards). Local, hometown decision-making is a critical element supporting MOUs, as well as ensuring access to a stable supply of electricity while protecting the environment. About two-thirds of these utilities do not generate their own electricity, but instead purchase wholesale power to distribute to their citizens/customers.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="Nanogrid">Nanogrid</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A nanogrid narrows the <a href="#Microgrid">microgrid</a> concept from a campus down to a single building, whose multiple onsite energy resources, energy storage and managed loads work together to provide energy self-sufficiency.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="NGMS">Nanogrid Management System (NGMS)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">An NGMS enables the efficient operation of a <a href="#Nanogrid">nanogrid</a>, balancing system resources, loads, and energy storage.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="NEM">Net Energy Metering (NEM)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">With the addition of onsite power production systems, utilities developed a new type of meter to enable onsite systems to be connected to the grid. First, the NEM differs from standard revenue meters by registering the net consumption (grid power minus onsite power). Generally, this would produce a reduced bill. But if onsite power were to exceed grid power in a given billing cycle, then the excess would be accounted for by a utility payment to the system owner.  Second, the NEM ensures worker safety by cutting off the onsite power production when the grid loses power (without a NEM, utility workers restoring power after a line or system outage would risk mistaking power lines still energized by onsite power systems for dead ones and suffering harmful or fatal power shocks). NEM has become a political football recently. Favored by third party system providers because it eases integration of onsite power systems, utilities have begun to challenge the NEM system in regulatory proceedings, claiming that NEM metered consumers constitute a new privileged class of energy consumers, driving up system costs because of interconnections, receiving payments for excess production, but consuming less grid power and so contributing less to the system in rate payments – effectively shifting the burden of maintaining the grid to non-NEM consumers. This remains an open, contentious issue with more and more utilities seeking to add a fixed charge for NEM consumers, while others advocate for a full accounting of the value of distributed generation with new Value of Solar Tariffs (VOSTs).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="NZEH">Net Zero Energy Home (NZEH)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A Net Zero Energy Home produces sufficient energy over the course of the year to balance out its annual power consumption for a net zero impact. Navigant predicts total NZEH units in NA will grow to nearly 27,000 in 2025.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="PaceProblem">Pace Problem</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Oriented to preserve system reliability and constrained on multiple fronts, electric utilities move slowly to adapt to the changes presented by new technologies. In contrast, technology companies and consumers, oriented to challenge the status quo with innovative approaches to problems and far less constrained, embrace change, even seeking to accelerate the pace of change to their advantage. Utilities risk falling further and further behind if they are not able to accelerate their adaptations to change.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="NTA">Non-Transmission Alternatives</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Non-Transmission Alternatives (NTAs) are transmission-related NWAs (see below) that specifically targeted at the grid’s transmission sector. Opportunities for NTAs are identified through more deliberate least-cost planning and action, one geographic area at a time.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="NWA">Non-Wires Alternatives</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Non-Wires Alternatives (NWAs) are electric utility system investments and operating practices that obviate the need for specific transmission and/or distribution projects. Key advantages are lower total resource cost and specific targeting of transmission congestion or distribution system constraints at times of greatest need in grid operations. A more comprehensive analysis reveals advantages for both NWAs and NTAs for managing electricity supply and demand using a wider variety of solutions than traditionally used in planning, including <a href="#DER">DER</a> on the demand side and rate design on the utility side.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="PersonalEnergy">Personal Energy</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Personal Energy expands on the traditional energy concept, whereby a commodity (i.e., grid power, dial-tone power, as <a href="#kW">kWhs</a>, BTUs, etc.) is purchased from a third party in an industrial context and delivered over a network, often under regulatory authority. Personal Energy redefines energy from the individual perspective, oriented to services and added value (i.e., energy self sufficiency, comfort as a service, lighting as a service, etc.) purchased from a competitive marketplace of service providers, generally without regulatory oversight, as a complement to self-produced value.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="PEPA">Personal Energy Purchase Agreement (PEPA)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A PEPA is any combination of <a href="#PPA">PPAs</a> and/or <a href="#ESPA">ESPAs</a> marketed to an end consumer/<a href="#Prosumer">prosumer</a> by either a utility or a 3rd party service provider. A PEPA is a concept not yet available, but likely to emerge as the market matures to focus on higher value-added services. A PEPA may be offered that totally replaces the monthly energy bill (e.g., comfort, lighting, and hot water LPAs reduce energy bill by 60% and solar PPA with energy storage covers the remaining 40%).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="PV">Photo Voltaic (PV)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">PV panels and film systems create electricity directly from sunlight and its interaction with the materials in the PV system. Silicon chips are mounted in solar cells on solar panels in rigid frames, while PV film has the active substance printed on a substrate (film) that can be applied to a variety of building materials (roofing tiles, wall panels, windows, etc.) to create building integrated PV (BIPV).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="PHEV">Plug In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">In contrast to a pure <a href="#EV">EV</a>, which runs strictly on electricity, a PHEV has a gas tank and internal combustion engine (ICE) as a complement to its electric batteries and power system. PHEVs have longer range, but produce more greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="PEB">Positive Energy Building (PEB)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A Positive Energy Building (PEB) produces more energy than it consumes on a daily basis, by design, introducing the potential of creating a dependable, long-term income stream based on an on-site energy investment. A PEB enables the potential to export power directly onto the distribution feeder as a <a href="#DPP">Distribution Power Producer (DPP)</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="PowerContinuity">Power Continuity</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Power Continuity ensures power availability for the end user regardless of the state of grid power. In a short or long-duration power outage, traditional power continuity strategies like back up power (e.g., diesel generators or UPS/battery banks), and dual-feed distribution circuits and new strategies like onsite power (e.g., <a href="#Microgrid">microgrids</a>, fuel cell arrays) address the need for continuous power for such <a href="#CEU">Critical Energy Users (CEUs)</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="PPA">Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Power Purchase Agreement or PPA is long-term (e.g., 10 year minimum) contract to buy 3rd party power. The PPA has proved to have a dramatic impact on the adoption of new technology, particularly on market penetration of rooftop <a href="#PV">Solar PV</a>, which saw a dramatic rise with the introduction of PPAs as an alternative to the purchase of expensive systems with long payback periods. A PPA may be seen as a Resource strategy, providing alternative energy to the transmission grid (w/a utility) or directly to a site on the distribution grid (w/a consumer, e.g., solar PPA as above).</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="Prosumer">Prosumer</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Where a consumer purchases energy to use as an input to create added value (light, power, comfort, convenience, security, etc), they become a prosumer, one who not only purchases but also produces energy to create expanded value.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="ProximityMicrogrid">Proximity Microgrid</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A Proximity Microgrid shifts the <a href="#Microgrid">microgrid</a> concept from colocated buildings on a single campus to co-located buildings on a specific segment of a distribution feeder that may be isolated for islanded operations.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="ResilientFeeder">Resilient Feeder</h4>
        <p class="pb30">As <a href="#DER">DER</a> capacity is steadily added to a distribution feeder, it may be considered by grid operators to have become a resilient feeder, supporting local <a href="#PowerContinuity">power continuity</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" id="ResilientSubstation">Resilient Substation</h4>
        <p class="pb30">When multiple <a href="#ResilientFeeder">Resilient Feeders</a> extend from a distribution substation, enabling it with new capabilities during an outage, it may be referred to as a resilient substation. Feeder-by-feeder, substation-by-substation, a distribution grid becomes more resilient in stages under such a transformation scenario.</p>
        <h4 class="white">Solar Photo Voltaic (Solar PV)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">See <a href="#PV">Photo Voltaic</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="SolarGarden">Solar Garden vs. Solar Farm</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A solar farm is a large installation, generally with capacity measured in <a href="#MW">MWs</a>, also called utility-scale solar, feeding its output onto a high voltage transmission system. Smaller than a solar farm, solar gardens have capacity measured in KWs. These ground-mounted systems have recently gained popularity as “right-sized” energy systems suitable for cooperative sharing or for community energy purposes. See also <a href="#CommunitySolar">Community Solar</a>.</p>
        <h4 class="ne white" if="SPEC">Strategic Positive Energy Collaborator (SPEC)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">A Strategic Positive Energy Collaborator (SPEC) harnesses the potential of a <a href="#Prosumer">prosumer</a> and a positive energy building or site that operates as a <a href="#Nanogrid">nanogrid</a>. Such new capabilities enable a new business model whereby a strategic positive energy collaborator exports power in a manner to complement or enhance the operations of the connected grid and the surrounding energy ecosystem to create synergy and added value not possible without collaboration.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="V2G">Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Vehicle-to-Home (V2H)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">These two terms are used to describe the transfer of power from an <a href="#EV">EV</a> to the grid or to the home (or building), where the EV becomes an alternative energy storage device acting as a power supply.</p>
        <h4 class="white" id="VPP">Virtual Power Plant (VPP)</h4>
        <p class="pb30">Virtual Power Plant or VPP describes a demand-side alternative to accommodate growth in peak demand to the traditional supply-side alternative of adding a natural gas power plant, commonly referred to as a peaking unit or a peaker. In its most expansive definition, a VPP combines an array of rooftop PV systems with localized energy storage and aggregated <a href="#DR">DR</a> capacity (e.g., <a href="#HEMS">HEMS</a> appliances equipped with direct load control – commonly, smart thermostats – or some combination). Such a system provides a utility the capacity needed to meet its peak needs without adding a power plant.</p>
